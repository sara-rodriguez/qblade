How to make OpenCL work under Linux?
The default driver "nouveau" does not support OpenCL. Therefore the proprietary NVIDIA driver ist required. Installation guide is
available at https://wiki.debian.org/NvidiaGraphicsDrivers. In case of an Optimus system, where the discrete GPU is turned off by
default, the nvidia driver must be chosen over the nouveau driver in /etc/bumblebee/bumblebee.conf. Additionally the nvidia ICD
must be installed. It is available in the repository.
To use OpenCL, the discrete GPU must be turned on by bumblebee. The easiest way to do so, is to run any program with optirun, e.g.
"optirun gedit".
