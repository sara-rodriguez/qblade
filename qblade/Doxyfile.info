The Doxyfile is used as configuration file for Doxygen. Doxygen is an open source programm that parses a projects
source code and creates a documentation out of it. See http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html for more information.


In order to get an uniform source code documentation on QBlade it is recommended to adhere to the following guidelines:
1. The documentation is located in the header files.
2. For classes and functions a brief description is provided. In Qt-style documentation /*! ... */ everything before the
   first full stop is interpreted as brief description. The following is the detailed description.
   In JavaDoc-style documentation /** ... */ the @brief keyword starts the brief description. The detailed description
   starts after an empty line.
3. For members there is no brief description (improves the overview in the help file).
4. For classes there is a detailed description.
5. For functions and members a detailed description is optional but in most cases useful.


Hints:
- To add a detailed description to member variables you can use ///< in the same line as the declaration.
- It makes no difference if a keyword starts with \ or @
- See all keywords at http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/commands.html
- When documenting, try to figure out what other developers need to know about your class or function:
   * what is it's purpose?
   * is there something forbidden to do with your class or function?
   * can inconsistend states occure?
   * are there known bugs?
   * or features that were not yet tested with particular parameters?
   * with @attention you can point out commonly made mistakes
   * in complicated cases you might give an example.
- For QtCreator there is a plugin supporting Doxygen. See http://dev.kofee.org/projects/qtcreator-doxygen/wiki
  If installed, you can create the documentation with Tools->Doxygen->Build_Doxygen_Documentation
  It will be stored in ./doc/
  With Tools->Options...->Help->Documentation->Add... you can add the ./doc/qch/QBlade.qch file to QtCreator. Now you can access
  the documentation with F1 via QtCreator help.
